315	Great. So doing experiments like that is really informative. Kind of figuring out what works for you and things that have been a big impact on your day, 15 minutes in the morning, making a much longer commute, you're not going to stick with that. So figuring out what impacts you and gives you the best benefit for the least amount of negative impact is something that's sustainable. If I could hold out until I get to work and eat a breakfast from there, that would also. That sounds like too long of a commute though, too.
2505	It was like 10 minutes before I was getting into bed. I was checking my emails one last time before I went to bed. Last night? Yeah. Then I checked email today and James posted like, you know, clearly upset. And then before I went to bed, he was like, I'm very upset at the...
2582	Good morning. Good morning. I had a good day yesterday. It was feeling like spring. Maybe one day it's feeling like spring, but, you know, good enough. So I took the kids out to the playground. And I started packing. Part of me thinks that moving could be really good. I don't know. Back to waiting and seeing. I don't know enough what the options are.
3176	Yes. This morning I woke up. You mean as opposed to drinking less coffee and booze? I wasn't nauseous. Right. Asshole. But I came back into the TV room and he was in his PJs, but he had a snowboarding helmet on. You know, if he doesn't pick it up this year, I'll do lessons again next year. He has it in him, you know. I think he's just a little nervous about falling.
24244	to sleep in on another day and I don't need him for anything, then I get, then I'm not mad about it and I can let it go. But when it impacts plans that we would be doing together and then I have to work around him because he stayed up all night, it's just really tiresome. Yeah. I'm sorry that you guys are having such a hard time being happy together.
24760	I couldn't remember. She said to go up on the Prozac, and I can't remember if she told me not to go up on the Prozac, but I'm going up on it anyways. I'm now taking 25 milligrams of the Loderma Green in the morning. What's that? The glycemic fat. Less than or more? More.
24782	Yeah, three. Three o'clock, yeah. But there'd be either or like three hours. I would feel like there was a, yeah, sometimes I can rally. Okay. But I think maybe I need to not ask myself to rally right now. I think that's why, because particularly after three hours of holding it together, you could. I hadn't thought about that. Yeah.
24947	It's okay for me to use it during the day or something. The thing is, the prescription is worded such that I can take another one per day. Part of me thinks it will interfere with my morning driving and commute. Does it make you tired? It used to when I took it. Eventually, I would get used to it, but the whole getting used to it period seems like it would be too much of a hassle for not that much reward.
25023	I mean, I have to figure out how to extract myself from the situation, you know? Riley has not been communicating to me at all about it. He just in one email said he no longer supports the litigation. And of course the email that I wrote out with our options. Luckily, I didn't talk about our trial strategy. But the disenfranchised woman ends up emailing it to the defendant. I'm picking a trial date on Tuesday. We have a closing that morning. Probably not going to be able to meet with you on Tuesday.
25077	So yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Finally get him on the phone again Sunday, like noontime. I don't know. Just feeling really low. I don't know. He actually wants me to call this woman and tell her to back off. I was like, well, I think that will just make things worse if she's serious. Impossible. It's just the way she was. So I would just wait to do that if you really want me to do it.
25256	And then it would come in today after 8 p.m. I'm like, well, I'm not going to take it until Monday anyway. So what's an extra day? So I haven't started it yet. Gotcha. So I'll probably start tomorrow. So how did the diagnostic process go? It was a series of questions. A lot of questions. Yeah. Of, you know, mild, moderate, or severe, or none at all. You know. Right.
25516	Things like the highest likelihood of success combined with what it's most likely I'd actually do. Yeah, logistics are hard, but not that hard. They're hard if I want them to be hard. This tutoring session's going to be more. I thought about just taking the car somewhere. I think maybe I just won't go to tutoring. When's it at? 2.30.
25685	I think James should come and you guys should go to the ER. And I think it's possible by the time I see you, you're feeling better enough or you think you're feeling a little better. If you're waiting there for three or four hours and you start to feel better, call me and you can come back here and we can talk. Okay. You know this evening, either of them, you can come by and we can go from there. I'm happy to do that, but there's something about that.
25790	Chicago visiting. She was living in Montana, so she came out to Chicago to visit, and there was a bunch of other people that had volunteered with us who lived in kind of like this Chicago metro area. So we were all planning on getting together that night from our conversations, getting to know each other while we were in Madagascar. I knew that everyone else liked to, we used to call it
25803	And though reading it, I was like, it's just like Sex and the City and Gossip Girl, only better. I was like, okay, I really don't want to see this show now. Not really my thing. He was talking about anxiety and describing having a panic attack the other night.
25874	to try to finish this up early. Then I, Friday morning, I have my actual appointment with Dr. Barnes. They're going down to Rhode Island and I actually need to help cook because my mom has an- What's going on with your mom? Did I tell you that like my parents have been fostering cats with kittens? Mm-hmm.
25952	So to get together this weekend long, something about multimedia stuff. It's kind of a conference in my library. So there's like keynotes each day with a catered lunch, like a bagged lunch and workshops or discussions running every day. So it's like two workshops in the morning, an hour and a half keynote at noon and then afternoon workshop.
26151	No, not really. It's like I did some work this morning, taking a shower. I don't know why. I just always feel it is a chore. But I had to take one today. After two weeks, I've gone to take a shower. I need a haircut. I should have gotten one today. I always buy supercuts. Do you get a supercut? I think you get a $100 haircut. It's $50, I think. It's gone up.
26193	I've been having the sun lamp and using it, especially because Sydney had gotten me a little mini orchid plant because I had seen them in the grocery store and thought they were so cool. He had gone grocery shopping a few days later, so the mini orchid, because of that, it's like it needs to have partial sunlight, and we have it in the middle of the room and not in the window, so we use the sun lamp. I also have it when I'm dying wool, so that ends up being at least sunlight.
26290	Usually people feel an effect in about 20 minutes. Okay. Yeah, that didn't happen last night. And usually a panic attack is over within 20 minutes, typically. Yes, which also didn't happen last night or any night, so. It's been a really rough couple of weeks. Yeah. What's been going on with Sidney? How's he been doing the past few weeks?
26362	So I had a real slop day yesterday. Just stayed in my PJs and slept on the couch and watched the inauguration all day. And I went out to get Chinese food, which I threw up this morning. Oh, no. Nice. Yeah. Which is probably a good thing because I ate too much. That's a pretty delayed throwing up. I mean, I know you like.
26392	Like we had to go to Sydney's house to get some packages that he had gotten. And so we went to the store on the way there. Then, you know, and he was driving there to the store and then to his place. But then on the way back, he asked if I could drive because he's not really good with night driving. And he was really, really tired. And I was like, okay, well, you're really, really tired. And I'm just panicking. And I drove home and managed to drive home without hitting anyone or doing anything unsafe and parked the car all while panicking. That's unusual. Yeah.
26523	There's a reason I'm not there all the time. I was there on Friday to get some errand stuff done. I think we're going there tonight so I can be there because I have to book tomorrow morning. And obviously my address is still my place. So I need to get down there to move before work. I think what we'll do is have dinner before we go there. That solves tonight, but that doesn't solve the rest of the week. He might have time in theory to go shop at Hamden or something like that. But I'm the one who has the car when I'm at work. That makes things harder too. I guess he could take the tea in theory and get there and get back.
26725	Sleep is a much better option than death. And it's even a better option than worrying about it. I know that you've always told me that when you have those thoughts, that you're not thinking about actually falling through on them. Rather than engaging in that cycle of thought for five minutes, if it's not nighttime, take a nap. That's better than engaging in a cycle of destructive thought. And maybe it will be better when you wake up, or maybe one of those other techniques can work, and you can get some control over it. And I would try those first.
27057	Hi, I'm one of the psychiatrists who work here in the Department of Psychological Medicine, and I'm seeing you today because you were referred up for the emergency room. I understand that you were brought in by ambulance last night after cutting your arms and overdosing on Tylenol. It looks like you were bandaged up. Are you feeling suicidal today? I never was. I need to get out of here. I need to see Carl. Is Carl your boyfriend? Yeah. How long have you been together?
27112	Does that sound like a temporary plan? I guess. It's my spring break, so I'm home unless I spend my days. I mean, I could go to the library every day, but... And he's at work? He now, as of this morning, has to schedule for the next couple days. Okay. So you'll have some time then apart in the evenings together? Hopefully.
27368	Your baby was removed and taken to foster care after the ambulance responded to your home last night. Can you tell me about the three other children? They took them from me. Nobody cares. Who the hell do they think they are? I hate you all. My kids need me. I wish Carl would come and get me from this place. Oh, screw him. What about your family? Can they help with the kids? Mom died when I was four and dad is drunk, so no good SOB. What do they care?
27655	evenings. I guess if I could cook things on Sunday or Monday. It would take a bunch of work, but I could. At least in theory, make a few quiches and then have a few quiches be my lunches for that week and possibly also dinners. So I could in theory cook things ahead of time and that would make the part easier. I usually still in the morning, getting breakfast together slows me down. Like even if I'm eating in the car. If I put cream cheese on the rice cakes the night before, then they'll get all sad.
27805	Good morning. Good morning. I'm at a loss as what to talk about again, although I think in a better way this week, in general, I feel better this week than I have for the last couple of weeks. That is a good thing. The causes are not immediately obvious, but I think some of it's feeling like I have been telling people that I'm upset and trying to deal with that in, I guess, different direct fashion. I don't know.
27826	I find this happening so much that I am late for my job. In the morning on my way to work, I have had to turn around and drive home to see if I remembered to turn off the coffee pot. This is embarrassing because I know what I am doing, but I can't stop it. What do you feel will happen if you do not do these things over and over?
28030	that was that has that was has disappeared it's hard to have that gone and the day we took her to the airport we took her at like five in the morning and we didn't get much sleep and I figured I'd just get you know have a day it started really early and it was destroyed all day I don't know if it was the exhaustion you you you
28148	I haven't really experimented with. I've at least figured out that if I'm going to cut up vegetables, it's better to do that at work and take a longer lunch than to have that chore in the morning. Well, not just that, but if I do it before I leave, 15 minutes will make a huge difference in the commute. So, I've started doing that at work. That feels a lot better for me.
28426	Oh my goodness. This was a night, you mean? This was Thursday after they killed that cop and got chased into chest tire. I don't know. It's going to take some time. And then what was it? 20 hours? I don't know. It's hard to put into words that kind of terror because at that point in your life, well, this guy has nothing. Obviously he knows it's over. They didn't care about dying or killing other people. So
28460	just stop going to Facebook. Stop looking at like deliberately torture yourself. Like, ooh, I'll start Facebook in the morning so I can feel bad all day. But he's right about that. Then I'm like, but I have to develop those impulses. And so I can be emotionally strong and look at those things objectively. And he's like, well, until you do that, you shouldn't. I don't know.
28605	How many times are you checking the locks on your doors and windows? I check everything before I leave work, when I come home from work and before bed and waking up in the morning. If I check three times, then it feels right. I feel relief if I check and count three times. How about your sleeping habits? Have you had any trouble with sleep?
29163	So it sounds like what's really making you feel anxious in moments or parts of the day is when you're kind of predicting the future, thinking about having to get to work. Will I have enough time? Will I have time to get this project done? Will I be able to do this thing on my own in the evening? How does it usually turn out?
29469	It's just hard to make all the right choices because it's so easy to like, you know, just sleep in. Like, you know, even on Monday morning, I had my game. Like the alarm went off and we had like more time that we could sleep. And I wanted to go back to sleep because I knew that if I stayed up for a certain amount of time, the tightness would come back. And then it did, you know, and the sleep seems like the only escape from it. And I can't sleep all the time. No, you can't.
29584	That should have taken 15 minutes. So bored, frustrated, no panic. When do you feel stressed? When you look back over the week and you say, I still feel stressed, when are you noticing it? I think it's when I get up in the morning and I have to get myself to work. Or in the evening when I need to get things done before I go to bed and I'm like, how will I have food for tomorrow or have dinner tonight?
29805	I need to be able to give you that feedback. And now he would say, that's ridiculous. You're overreacting. So I think he heard that a little bit last night. I also think, you know, he says my perception is not right. Clearly his perception is not right. It's like, there's no point in trying to. There are times I say, okay, I'm going to write it down on the calendar. Every day that Harold says that he doesn't feel well. Every day that he does this.
29928	What have you been taking for meds? I have the 85 milligram of desipyramine and my birth control pill, vitamin D, vitamin B complex, and that's only in the morning. In the evening, it's the 75 milligrams of Cerakol and 25, whatever it is, milligrams of Clonopin.
30082	Well, hopefully Ian will go to bed early. Sunday morning, I'll probably end up sleeping late. I'll probably be a little hungover. The whole thing just makes me anxious. I don't know if it's just the closing that makes me anxious or if it's having all of these things to do. I had a week of a kind of coming home and just doing.
30219	He's going to sleep in my bed tonight. He's going to learn to skate tomorrow. It's going through March. That seems like an awful long time to teach kids to skate. I would think that at some point they'd give them a stick and a puck, and I don't know. So I got to do that tomorrow. His Cub Scouts are visiting a fire station at 10. Neat.
30904	He went from crying all the way through church, afterwards telling me how we're getting a divorce. Then at lunch, like nothing ever happened, happy. And then later in the evening, like crying a little bit again and then up and down and then up again and down. It is so sharp and it's so, he's actually doing. And again, I can't even tell him this is going on or that I'm struggling with this because he's totally unaware. He's in his own. He's also doing a little bit of, it feels pretty manipulative. And my sister said.
30934	So what is it you think that you can do during those months when you're having, when you're technically still at your place to alleviate some of the worries that you have about having enough time or being able to accomplish tasks? I don't really know. Other than take one day a week, like Sundays, to start packing if I'm not sick. Is that what you're worried about, packing? Because what you mentioned before is sort of having enough time in the evening or getting to work on time.
31325	Yeah, actually he is. It's hard to think about how we'd actually do it in our crazy house and what would actually need to happen. Have you ever looked into going to a meditation center? Yeah, there is one in the square. It would be at night. For him to go out at night, it would be... And it doesn't have to be.
31981	Even waking up at 11 and was up for several hours, I just blew it off. And I'm not really even anxious or stressed out about it. Really what was interesting is that Sunday morning was one of those days I get anxious about. I had to take Ian to snowboarding. Right. You're taking him snowboarding and you're meeting Jess and then going to the game. Right.
31985	I was just not with it at all. I didn't even remember nothing about this panel. I was in the bathroom trying to puke the entire time, and I just kept looking at myself in the mirror saying, you're going to be fine. You're going to be fine. And I was just, like, not with it, and then I just came down. I was so hard, and I had a horrible rest of the night.
31992	With the game being at 6.30 on Sunday, I won't have to worry about getting him out of there right away. You have plenty of time. I might try and see if I can get him some extra runs. He's never done the tow rope. They've got a little bunny hill, like the teaching hills have magic carpets, which he did fine with. All the other kids are hopping right on it, and he's like inching forward, you know.
32205	Hi, come on in. Thank you. Good morning. So last week, this time, I think I was out of practice, was part of it just like it had been a long time. And I think, so you asked if I knew I was frustrated. And I don't know what I said, if I answered that at the time, but I had known that I was frustrated, but not perhaps the extent to which I was not talking about being frustrated, and thus had difficulty talking about being frustrated with you.
32365	When he finally rolled out of bed at 8.30, I was like, that was totally unfair. Don't ever do that again. I know it's not fair to you if I take up more space on the bed, and maybe you have to go sleep on the couch, and that's not fair. But I need to be able to sleep, and I have so much trouble sleeping. He just went off at me and yelled at me about how I wasn't doing anything about my sleep problems, and he had told me to try vitamin D because that would fix my sleep problems, and why wasn't I better?
